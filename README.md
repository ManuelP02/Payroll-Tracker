# Employee Tracker App

## Summary
This week's challenge involves modifying starter code to create a payroll management application that runs in the browser. The application will allow a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.
The application should have the following user story and acceptance criteria:


## User Story
As a payroll manager, I want an employee payroll tracker so that I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company.


## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I click the "Add employee" button.

THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary.

WHEN I finish adding an employee.

THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel.

WHEN I choose to continue.

THEN I am prompted to add a new employee.

WHEN I choose to cancel.

THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data.

The application should have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
